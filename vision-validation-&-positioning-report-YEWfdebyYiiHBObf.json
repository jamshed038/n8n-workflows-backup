If it’s specific and relevant, explain why it’s strong and suggest 2 ways to make it even more compelling. If it’s vague or missing, guide the user on how to define it by identifying: (a) who is affected, (b) what the problem is, (c) why it matters now. Give an example problem statement in simple language, and suggest one way they can test if it’s a real problem in their community.\n\n\n# THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING Output Sample:\nTHE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING:\nOriginal Response:\nThe world utilizes technology more now, and the focus is to ensure that young adults understand how to apply AI so their jobs do not become obsolete, allowing them to continue earning a living.\n\nPG SMART SYSTEMS:\nThis concern is critical as automation progresses. Highlight how the digital divide can exacerbate socioeconomic disparities without targeted intervention.\n\nPG SMART SYSTEMS:\nYou’ve identified a real concern — job loss from automation — but your statement can be sharper. Funders respond better when they know exactly who is impacted, what’s at stake, and why action is urgent.\n\nNext Steps:\nAdd a short example of how someone in your audience could lose or keep a job with AI skills.\nInclude a local stat or news headline about AI’s impact in Atlanta.\nTest this problem statement by asking 3–5 people in your target group if it resonates with them.\n\n\n\nWHO IS MOST AFFECTED? Instructions:\nCheck if the audience description is detailed enough to guide outreach. If it’s too broad, missing, or “I don’t know,” explain why narrowing the audience will make marketing easier. Suggest 2–3 ways to figure out their ideal audience (e.g., surveys, social media groups, talking to community leaders). Give one example of a focused audience description.\n\n\n# WHO IS MOST AFFECTED Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nYoung adults, male and female, ages 25–45 in Atlanta, GA. They are often entrepreneurs or employed in low-paying jobs.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nTargeting this demographic can enhance economic resilience. Tailor efforts to address both entrepreneurial and employed sectors for broad impact.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nYou’ve identified age and location, but the group is still broad. The more specific you are, the easier it is to find and serve them.\n\nNext Steps:\nNarrow to a smaller group first (e.g., rideshare drivers, salon owners, entry-level office workers).\nCreate a short profile of your ideal participant: age, work, income, goals, challenges.\nIdentify where they gather (online and in-person) so you can target outreach.\n\n\n\n# WHY NOW Instructions:\nSee if the “why now” statement builds urgency. If it’s strong, say why and give 1–2 ways to use it in marketing. If it’s weak or missing, explain how to create urgency by connecting the issue to trends, news, or data. Give an example of a strong “why now” and suggest 2 quick research tips to make theirs stronger.\n\n\n# WHY NOW Sample Final Putput:\nOriginal Response:\nAI is currently disrupting many industries, leading to companies implementing AI solutions and hiring fewer people.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nThe urgency aligns with global trends. Demonstrating adaptability skills can empower individuals amidst evolving business practices.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nYou’ve shown urgency, but you can make it more compelling by connecting to local trends or data.\n\nNext Steps:\nFind 1–2 examples of Atlanta companies using AI to change hiring or job roles.\nUse these in grant proposals and marketing to show funders the time to act is now.\nLink your program to immediate action (“skills they can use tomorrow”) rather than distant benefits.\n\n\n\n# COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE Instructions:\nIf they’ve listed competitors, assess whether they are relevant and complete. If it’s “I don’t know,” blank, or vague, explain why knowing competitors matters. Give 3 simple, no-cost ways to find similar organizations (Google search, social media, local nonprofit directories). Suggest how to use competitor info to find collaboration opportunities, not just avoid competition.\n\n# COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nNo research conducted on similar nonprofits.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nInvestigate local and national entities to uncover potential partnerships or avoid market overlap. Awareness can refine strategic direction.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nYou haven’t researched competitors yet, but this is a critical step. Without it, you risk duplicating programs or missing partnerships.\n\nNext Steps:\nSearch online for “AI training nonprofit Atlanta” and “workforce development Atlanta.”\nList 3 organizations, what they offer, and who they serve.\nIdentify at least one group you could collaborate with to expand your impact.\n\n\nCOMPETITOR GAPS Instructions\nIf they list gaps, add 1–2 they may have missed. If they don’t know, explain why gaps are important and how they help with positioning. Provide 3 common nonprofit gaps (e.g., outdated programs, weak online presence, slow response times). Give 1 quick way to spot these gaps.\n\n# COMPETITOR GAPS Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nI don’t know.\n\nPG Smart Sytems:\nIdentifying gaps, even basic ones like those in digital outreach or community engagement, can offer significant competitive advantages.\n\nPG Smart Sytems:\nYou don’t know the gaps yet, but spotting them will help you stand out. Common nonprofit gaps include:\nWeak online visibility.\nOutdated program content.\nLittle hands-on support for participants.\n\nNext Steps:\nVisit competitor websites and social pages.\nLook for areas where they seem slow, outdated, or disconnected.\nPosition your program as a fresh, responsive alternative.\n\nYOUR UNIQUE VALUE Instructions:\nIf their answer clearly shows what makes them unique, affirm it and suggest 2 ways to prove it to funders or partners. If it’s vague or missing, guide them to think about what they offer that no one else does, including experience, skills, connections, or methods. Give 1 example of a strong unique value statement.\n\n# YOUR UNIQUE VALUE Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nWith over 10 years in the tech field and access to tech experts, there's a robust foundation for offering specialized programs.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nLeverage expertise and networks to create a compelling, informed curriculum that resonates with real-world industry standards.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nYou have strong experience and access to experts — now link that directly to participant benefits.\n\nNext Steps:\nWrite a one-sentence value statement that’s easy for anyone to understand.\nGather 2–3 quick success stories that show your expertise in action.\nAsk a friend if your value statement is clear and exciting — refine if needed.\n\nMVP STRATEGY Instructions:\nIf they list a realistic MVP, confirm it and give 1–2 improvements. If unclear, “I don’t know,” or too ambitious, explain why starting small is best. Suggest 2–3 quick, low-cost MVP ideas and 1 way to test them with real feedback.\n\n#MVP STRATEGY Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nThe initial approach will be launching a workshop.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nBegin with small, targeted sessions to refine the offering. Gather feedback to iterate rapidly and build a scalable model.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nA workshop is a great start, but focus on keeping it simple and impactful.\n\nNext Steps:\nTeach one skill that delivers an immediate win.\nTest with a small group and collect feedback.\nAdd a follow-up activity so participants keep practicing.\n\nINITIAL AUDIENCE Instructions:\nCompare this to “Who Is Most Affected.” If they match and are specific, affirm it. If vague, missing, or too broad, explain why focus matters and give 2 steps to narrow. Provide 1 example of a refined target audience.\n\n# INITIAL AUDIENCE Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nAdults ages 25–45.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nA broad initial focus can help identify segment-specific needs. Deploy agile strategies to adapt quickly based on diverse participant feedback.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nThis matches your “most affected” group, but you can grow faster by focusing first.\n\nNext Steps:\nPick one primary audience to target initially.\nTailor your outreach to their specific needs and challenges.\nExpand to other groups once you have proof of success.\n\nMVP SUCCESS METRICS Instruction:\nIf they have strong metrics, add 1–2 more ideas. If vague or “I don’t know,” explain why tracking outcomes is key to funding and improvement. Give 2–3 easy metrics they can measure and suggest one low-effort way to collect data.\n\n# MVP SUCCESS METRICS Sample Final Output:\nOriginal Response:\nAn assessment test at the end of the workshop will determine information retention.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nComplement assessments with peer reviews and self-evaluation tools to capture comprehensive success metrics.\n\nPG Smart Systems:\nYour assessment test is a good start, but funders love to see real-world outcomes.\n\nNext Steps:\nTrack how many participants use their new skill within 30 days.\nMeasure confidence or job opportunities gained.\nSend a 1-month follow-up survey for ongoing impact data.\n\n📌 MANDATORY OUTPUT RULE — USE BELOW HTML CODE BELOW FOR THE FINAL OUTPUT\n- As your final step, you must create the output following 100% this HTML.\n- You are not allowed to return plain text outside of the HTML.\n- Generate PG Smart System'Ss Versions dynamically depending on the quality of the input.\n- Keep the order and section names exactly as in the template — no extra or missing sections.\n- The document must strictly match the \"HTML Output Template\" provided below — nothing more, nothing less.  \n- No extra sections, no missing sections, no changes to heading names or order.\n- MANDATORY TO GIVE HTML CODE IN OUTPUT \n- Never use tables for anything else — only for Market Positioning Summary.\n- Analyze the full report content and extract the most relevant details for \"Operating Area,\" \"Niche,\" \"Unique Methodology,\" \"Regional Gap,\" and \"MVP Focus\" to populate the Marketing Summary table dynamically.\n- Analyze the given Original Response in full context.\n- PG Smart Systems: write at least 3–4 paragraphs, each 5+ sentences, with examples, references to audience/location, specific outreach methods, and measurable targets.\n- PG Smart Systems: same length and depth, but with a different strategic approach.\n\n- Next Steps:\nWrite at least 7–10 bullet points, each 2–3 sentences explaining the action, why it matters, and how to execute it.\nInclude timelines, KPIs, resource requirements, and risk mitigation.\nProvide sample outreach messages or templates tailored to the audience and location.\nEnsure the tone is professional, actionable, and grounded in the provided context.\n\n-Generate an HTML section titled \"Market Positioning Summary\" using the user’s input, and always place a table at the very end of the HTML (same structure as the sample, just fill it with the provided data).\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\">\n<title>VISION VALIDATION & POSITIONING REPORT</title>\n<style>\n  body {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    background: #f7fafc;\n    color: #0b1724;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 20px;\n  }\n  .container {\n    max-width: 900px;\n    margin: auto;\n    background: white;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n  }\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 26px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    margin: 20px 0;\n  }\n  h2 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    margin: 25px 0 10px 0;\n  }\n  .meta {\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n  }\n  .section-content {\n    margin-bottom: 12px;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n  }\n  .label {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  ul {\n    margin-top: 5px;\n    margin-bottom: 15px;\n  }\n  table {\n    width: 100%;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    margin-top: 10px;\n  }\n  table th, table td {\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n    padding: 8px;\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n  table th {\n    background: #f1f1f1;\n  }\n  footer {\n    margin-top: 20px;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <h1>VISION VALIDATION &amp; POSITIONING REPORT</h1>\n  <p class=\"meta\">Organization Name: <strong>XYZ-Organization</strong></p>\n  <p class=\"meta\">Prepared by: <strong>Smart Systems | PreciseGrants</strong></p>\n  <p class=\"meta\">Date: 12th of August 2025</p>\n  <hr>\n\n  <!-- 1 -->\n  <h2>1. THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING</h2>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">Original Response:</span><br>Our nonprofit is addressing the lack of digital skills and career readiness programs for underemployed and unemployed women from low-income and immigrant communities in the United States. Many face barriers such as limited technology access, language obstacles, and a lack of guidance on navigating remote work opportunities. Without targeted intervention, these women remain in low-wage jobs or excluded from the digital economy entirely.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>This problem statement effectively highlights a critical issue for a specific demographic. To enhance its impact, you can emphasize the broader socioeconomic implications and include quantitative data to illustrate the scale of the problem.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>Focus on the compelling need for digital inclusivity among marginalized women to ensure equitable workforce participation in the evolving economy.</p>\n  <p class=\"label\">Next Steps:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Gather statistical data on digital disparities among low-income women in the U.S.</li>\n    <li>Incorporate testimonials or case studies for emotional engagement.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr>\n\n  <!-- 2 -->\n  <h2>2. WHO IS MOST AFFECTED</h2>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">Original Response:</span><br>Women aged 21–40 in urban and suburban areas with high poverty rates — particularly immigrants, single mothers, and women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups — who have basic English proficiency but no formal digital training or career support.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>The audience description is well-defined, which is crucial for targeted outreach and resource allocation. Further refining could involve identifying specific cities or neighborhoods for pilot programs.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>Consider honing in on specific communities with pilot initiatives for more tailored and effective programming.</p>\n  <p class=\"label\">Next Steps:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Conduct community surveys to identify interest and readiness.</li>\n    <li>Establish partnerships with local organizations for outreach.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr>\n\n  <!-- 3 -->\n  <h2>3. WHY NOW</h2>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">Original Response:</span><br>Post-pandemic, the U.S. workforce has shifted toward remote and hybrid jobs, yet women from low-income and immigrant backgrounds are still underrepresented in these roles. Federal and state initiatives are investing heavily in digital workforce development, and many industries are facing labor shortages in online services and remote support roles — creating a timely opportunity to bridge the gap.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>The sense of urgency is well-articulated, leveraging post-pandemic trends and current policy focus. Strengthen this by using specific examples of sectors with acute workforce shortages.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>Highlight specific industries and geographical areas where digital skills are most needed and gaps are largest.</p>\n  <p class=\"label\">Next Steps:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Research and document industries with a high demand for digital skills.</li>\n    <li>Use this data in communications with stakeholders to create immediate calls to action.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr>\n\n  <!-- 4 -->\n  <h2>4.

COMPETITOR GAPS</h2>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">Original Response:</span><br>Existing workforce development programs often focus on traditional trades or generic job readiness. Many do not offer culturally responsive digital training, bilingual instruction, or direct placement into real income opportunities through freelancing and remote work platforms.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>This identification of gaps reinforces a unique organizational positioning. Further refine by evaluating effectiveness and needs in current trainees' experiences.</p>\n  <p class=\"section-content\"><span class=\"label\">PG Smart Systems:</span><br>Focus on closing these gaps with targeted, innovative programming that addresses the specific needs unveiled by competitor inadequacies.</p>\n  <p class=\"label\">Next Steps:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Conduct focus groups with previous participants to understand unmet needs.</li>\n    <li>Adapt programs based on direct feedback to enhance competitive advantage.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <hr>\n\n  <!-- 6 -->\n  <h2>6.
