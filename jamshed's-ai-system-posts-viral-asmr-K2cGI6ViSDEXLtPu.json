These videos must be 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nYou will receive the name of a glass object (e.g. \"glass apple\", \"glass mushroom\", \"glass croissant\"). Your task is to generate a hyper-realistic, sensory-rich video prompt of that object being cut in a close-up ASMR scene.\n\n## Core Requirements:\n- The video must feel cinematic and photorealistic.\n- Scene is a static, close-up shot of a dark wooden cutting board and a large, heavy steel knife.\n- Cutting must look physically possible — glass should break cleanly, not shatter, with smooth, controlled slices.\n- The video starts immediately with the cutting action.\n- The object must retain some color (e.g. red glass apple, green glass pear) — not fully transparent — to create visual contrast.\n- No humans visible. Only one hand holding the knife, the other stabilizing the object.\n- The cut should include **four distinct ASMR sound layers**:\n  1. The sharp tap of the knife touching the glass  \n  2. The smooth, controlled slicing sound through the glass  \n  3. The soft thud as the knife hits the board  \n  4. The delicate clink as the cut piece lands on the board  \n- The **initial knife-glass contact should sound especially crisp and prominent**, like metal striking polished glass.\n\n## Prompt Requirements\n1. **Scene Description**: Detail the board material (e.g. walnut), light setup (e.g. soft top-down), and camera style.\n2. **Object Detail**: Describe the object’s color, shape, texture, and reflective qualities.\n3. **Cutting Action**: Describe the cut from start to finish with a smooth break — no splintering or shattering.\n4. **Sound Design**: Use vivid language to highlight the four-layer audio experience:\n   - Knife-glass contact\n   - The clean slice through colored glass\n   - The thud of knife on wood\n   - The glass piece gently hitting the board\n5. **Ambience**: Total silence except for cutting sounds. No music, talking, or background noise.\n\n## Format Output Like This:\n\n**Subject**: A hyper-detailed [glass object] resting on a dark wooden cutting board.  \n**Setting**: Static close-up, soft natural lighting, minimal background.  \n**Action**: A large steel knife slowly slices through the [glass object], breaking it into perfect segments with a deliberate, cinematic cut.  \n**Style**: Cinematic ASMR realism, photorealistic lighting and textures.  \n**Sound**: Four high-fidelity sound layers in each cut — (1) ultra high definition sound as the knife makes contact with the glass, (2) a clean, smooth slicing sound, (3) a muted wooden thud, and (4) a precise clink as each piece lands. The initial tap should be especially sharp and prominent, emphasizing the contact of steel on glass. No other audio.  \n**Camera Motion**: Fixed camera with slight focus shifts during movement.  \n**Composition**: Centered object, knife enters from edge.  \n**Ambiance**: Pin-drop silence around the cutting sounds.  \n**Aspect Ratio**: Always 9:16\n\nMake the viewer feel immersed — like they can hear and feel every slice. Visually surreal, physically satisfying."}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":2,"position":[1780,0],"id":"3d526056-edc4-4f87-a4b6-68e3a42531de","name":"Prompt Agent"},{"parameters":{"method":"POST","url":"=https://viralapi.vadoo.tv/api/create_ai_clips","authentication":"genericCredentialType","genericAuthType":"httpHeaderAuth","sendBody":true,"specifyBody":"json","jsonBody":"={\n  \"url\": \"{{ $json[\\\"output\\\"] }}\",\n  \"theme\": \"Hormozi_1\",\n  \"language\": \"English\",\n  \"num_clips\": 1\n}\n","options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest","typeVersion":4.2,"position":[2140,0],"id":"8d7b5dc9-5384-4b35-a730-ce79c0e2fb36","name":"HTTP Request"},{"parameters":{"resource":"assistant","operation":"create","modelId":{"__rl":true,"mode":"list","value":""},"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi","typeVersion":1.8,"position":[2760,20],"id":"22f80348-b08c-43bb-bce8-3b7b5eaeaa8b","name":"Create an assistant"}],"connections":{"Schedule Trigger":{"main":[[{"node":"Get row(s) in sheet","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Get row(s) in sheet":{"main":[[{"node":"Aggregate","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Aggregate":{"main":[[{"node":"Edit Fields","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Edit Fields":{"main":[[{"node":"Idea Agent","type":"main","index":0}]]},"OpenAI Chat Model":{"ai_languageModel":[[{"node":"Idea Agent","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0},{"node":"Prompt Agent","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0}]]},"Structured Output Parser":{"ai_outputParser":[[{"node":"Idea Agent","type":"ai_outputParser","index":0}]]},"Idea Agent":{"main":[[{"node":"Prompt Agent","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Prompt Agent":{"main":[[{"node":"HTTP Request","type":"main","index":0}]]}},"settings":{"executionOrder":"v1"},"staticData":null,"meta":null,"pinData":{},"versionId":"59a3197f-a24c-40de-9847-2e1c6568b321","triggerCount":0,"tags":[]}
