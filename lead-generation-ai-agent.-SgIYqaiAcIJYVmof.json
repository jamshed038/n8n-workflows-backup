Woodruff, Director of Strategic Partnerships at mHUB , reminded us of the need to understand the regulatory hurdles that have the ability to impact progress. (See BIPA). Alongside co-host Matthew Louis, thank you both for fostering a thoughtful space grounded in community, learning, and presence.\n\nA few insights:\n\nElizabeth Barisik from Visier on agentic AI as a baseline for business and enterprise SaaS development — where data + context = the new moat. She emphasized the rapid growth of AI use behind the scenes, transforming ideas into tangible assets, way faster than we think.\n\nNickhil Tekwani- leading in product and Gen AI at McDonalds, shared how AI can drive customer feel-good moments through latency unlocks and improved experience connectivity.\n\nNate Carson shared insights on Uber’s AI adoption through the future of “human” work in enhancing AI models.\n\nChris Anderson’s story was truly inspiring. I love how he and his wife brought their children along their science and technology journey. What started with Lego kits contributed to an AI-powered global defense system!  He also invited us to demo his new product - Ai.rplane\n\nMakunde G. - building an amazing career and shared his journey to Google. He recommended book Algorithms of Oppression — a powerful reminder that algorithms can marginalize as easily as they can innovate. Makunde emphasizes community as the foundation for innovation for all.\n\nMichelangelo D'Agostino (Grainger) noted the need for net-new assets vs. retrofitting existing systems. He shared Grainger’s rich Chicago history and how it has led in innovation over the past nearly 100 years.\n\nCait Moran emphasized the human’s role in the future of AI, focused on emotionally intelligent design for autonomous digital teams. “Don’t teach tools. Teach decision-making.”\n\nBut my absolute favorite moment?\n🧠 Following the event, a deep, perspective-shifting conversation with Shawn HE YUXUN on quantum AI and the future of human utility when our “first-person view” begins to orbit around AI.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake? I got to share the experience with my wonderful sister Kymberley R. ❤️","time":"2 weeks ago","urn":"7343703988325728257"},{"images":[{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEF71FCo9Q-lw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZeiCJTFGQAg-/0/1750770161220?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=sPAx1oxEco-jNQQOWCUVbvTtXLAhfl92SgMqFylc03c"}],"num_comments":1,"num_empathy":2,"num_likes":4,"num_praises":2,"num_reactions":8,"num_reposts":3,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7343262296250400769/","posted":"2025-06-24 13:02:42","poster_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/chicago-startup-events","repost_stats":{"num_appreciations":0,"num_comments":1,"num_empathy":2,"num_interests":0,"num_likes":4,"num_maybe":0,"num_praises":2,"num_reactions":8,"num_reposts":3},"repost_urn":"7343299811330134018","reposted":"2025-06-24 15:31:46","reshared":true,"text":"🌞 Hey Chicago builders and dreamers, the first rule of success is showing up!

This was a timely, rescheduled conversation on local solutions, sustainability, and scaling tech for environmental change. \n\nTHU (6/12) – inspired by the amazing work of The Chicago Community Trust’s Young Leaders Fund (YLF), I came to congratulate Noma S., a 2025 grantee using tech to drive impact in youth development. A real reminder that innovation and equity go hand in hand. Congratulations to the 16 awardees! \nNoma is also Founder of Youth Sports Science Institute, where she employs an innovative approach that combines sports training with traditional STEM/STEAM instructional models.\n\nGrateful for the ideas, energy, and people shaping what’s next.

In case you didn’t know, the next generation just clocked in! He’s working to match highly skilled college seniors and recent graduates to growing startups and businesses. Every student is vetted, trained, and ready to execute. Founders love the output and the costs stay reasonable. One platform to hire, manage, and get the work done. Post a project!\n\nJoe Cruz , Owner/Operator of Ava’s Italian Ice and Honey Bomb Elixirs (https://lnkd.in/guKncKyy), co-sponsored today’s event with samples of three signature elixir flavors.

I can confirm they taste amazing :-)\n\nPanel: Innovating Without Breaking the Bank, led by Stuart Bernstein.\nIn this economic landscape, this was the news founders need. Topics included enabling innovation, fostering a culture of problem-solving, and strategies for experimenting and iterating, all while staying aligned with growth plans.\n\nPanel: The Future of Work & Investment, led by Angi Milano.\nLean scaling, organizational effectiveness, acceleration with AI as table stakes, the pros and cons of having a co-founder, and the evolution of investing through the VC lens.\n\nFireside chat with Betsy Z. and Wallace Harris, Jr., President at BMO Harris Investment Services.\nThe focus here was on building and investing in community as a mechanism for business growth and development—a powerful reminder that community-driven growth is real. Wallace also spoke on moving past the 'no' to find workable solutions.\n\nThe 1871 team truly delivers excellence at every single event. Their behind-the-scenes efforts are what make these experiences not just successful, but impactful. Major kudos to the team!\n\nGrateful for the community we’re building.

She sold Queen’s Way clothing, Avon, Tupperware, Brown & Bigelow. I recall attending different home events.\n\nIn the late 80s they opened a t-shirt shop, selling a variety of heat-pressed and custom designs, plus my father was delivering custom spray painting designs. The business thrived. My sister worked there. My father began screen printing in the evenings, and they built to securing 1000+ item orders. I remember a lot of t-shirt folding!\n\nMy father later opened a cleaning business serving other businesses, employing family and friends.\n\nMy father worked full time as an electrician from 19 years old until retirement. He continued as a practicing electrician until his late 60s, including serving for several years as an electrician instructor.\n\nMy mother worked full time as a mental health physician’s assistant for many years. I would go to work with her sometimes, filing and calling the patients back to the doctor.

For two days, the space was alive with energy from AI and Web3 leaders, investors, and builders shaping the next wave of innovation. I chose the AI track — focused on how industries are navigating adoption at scale and where real impact lies.\n\nThere was so much to take in, but here’s a glimpse of what stuck with me:\n\nKeith Toney, EVP, Discover: Talked candidly about AI’s “change ceiling” — where layers of data access, organizational fear, and governance challenges can stall innovation. You have to recognize AI fear as real. Label it. Talk about it. Build the right sponsorship. And, only build things you can't buy.\n\nMatt Renner, who leads cybersecurity at Antares Capital, offered a powerful framework for thinking about effective AI implementation. He emphasized that true scale comes from repeatability — it’s not enough to have one-off wins; success hinges on consistent execution across use cases. He underscored the need for clear leadership alignment, warning that without top-down clarity, AI efforts often stall.\n\n\"AI in Academia - Transforming the Classroom and Beyond\"\nXiaochen Z., CEO, Fintech4Good: Co-hosted the day and led the panel that challenged us to think globally — policy, education, and ethics must shape responsible AI.\n< Aravinda Garimella, Professor, Gies\n I really enjoyed Aravinda's commentary and perspective on building the next generation of AI contributors and leaders. She's super committed to ensuring both tacit and explicit student knowledge. Aravinda raised and discussed a critical point: academia must evolve both ethically and technically to lead in the AI era. \n< David Zaretsky, PhD, Professor, Pritzker School of Law\nAmongst many areas of expertise, David teaches an amazing course on the evolution of AI and its ethical and legal considerations to law students at Northwestern - literally building the course in real-time to ensure the latest insights and updates are interwoven into student learning and understanding. I'd love to be invited to observe a class!\n\n\"Web3 & AI - A Real Conversation About Energy & Data cCenters\"\n< Amber Orr, Director of Engineering & Energy Services\n Through her breadth of industry knowledge, she so casually educated us about 'power factor', edge compute and power delivery. Amber reminded us that energy and infrastructure aren’t side notes but are truly at center stage in scalable AI. You gained a fan.\n\nHuge congrats to the AI startup pitch finalists:\nDeepNeed, Levee, MEGI Health, nutrād, Oraczen — bold ideas, sharp execution! I'm rooting for you all.\n\nI'm always grateful for new conversations, so thanks to Noma S., Rob Wellen, MSIM, and Kyree Blount — let’s keep building.\n\nAs always, thank you Betsy Ziegler and the incredible 1871 team for a fitting finale at the Mart — and the spark for what’s next.\n\nYou can't grow community without showing up.

Are you building the set of systems to make your company sustainable?\n--\n#B2BSaaS #Fractional #CustomerSuccess #Retention #Startups #RevenueGrowth #CustomerExperience #SaaSAlignment #Leadership #ScaleSmarter #Founders #VCSaaS","time":"3 months ago","urn":"7318264413919092738"},{"images":[{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHq8TFn-I1sQg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1Bz9OHQA0-/0/1744646392841?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=zY_evITdUQxxm6HAJ0lHWIE0nR_zSdAJycis2x4fXSI"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEQ0ee0WF3QlA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0F1GoAo-/0/1744646481158?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=BbnZZ67UDbuXbA7322uX3xN0BmTNojapuE9U5xE3fF4"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGE8A83eUaNLA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0BgGQA0-/0/1744646472277?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=_dwzRbv8ZZcY_haSbxkcWRTz3r9ZPi0g5khb3HlT33A"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHitkmQYmUhyQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0BKHoAs-/0/1744646457222?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=AHD7qF72jgm78M-WA4s-WswDWSROu0J2HhYcvcFenJ0"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHC2QJQx1DnCA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0B_GoAo-/0/1744646463483?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=Bm4Oe6MWeQRyKNMn0gKmWSOnUeWU3bOObEKzNpMYDEU"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGoCrW7Gfaf-w/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0AaH0Ak-/0/1744646445283?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=F75rNeAoU5ADXBeC0rlvxpVks9BuAslE_x63ucvUqvc"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQG1Pa6VPB972A/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0B9GoAo-/0/1744646456354?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=g0labIA2_fJCMJMy0ed5bGd8F0_JmjWWoWucGbWc7QE"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGfP5-IWY3t8Q/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0DMGUAk-/0/1744646475088?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=hX5WtSdpNwK2SVCRDCFA36nfs5FlEAb7QYJSoNitbs8"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFvthNZFsSZKQ/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0CSHQAk-/0/1744646470761?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=ZQ4jD8vYf55hdsSlx4YLZ1VzpcMVGFdjNGSOQ9bwXvQ"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFsX5bv52ZCkA/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0B1GcAk-/0/1744646449783?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=_DIywjOthZe9wDdufxeFiBDaev1dNRemLC1upUocyks"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGu70OF7w71rg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0B4GsAk-/0/1744646459571?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=8KxYG8_HriKFMNXbt6iv-qnpiX3Y0ouGOoiZIm26c70"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQE_wt53XyP3Wg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0FBGUAs-/0/1744646480754?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=Y5SdhPt6_-JwQzc1tOghsSDr57yeCoeZLCjyn82c_fU"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGis-ytI7ENwQ/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0GUGUAw-/0/1744646462403?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=JOquvNtVxvpY8yYtfUbwxhBW2ACq8FXQPWsCjGL3Wpg"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGJrqQ-STHdHA/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0G2GQAs-/0/1744646486550?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=7JdcdlO0ecOXNiJeXopWYXocAJR5MDsJj6Q8N4yInH0"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFtAbzKXTl0vg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0HQGcAo-/0/1744646483034?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=btdFgYYaCVA7AtZzr25y-ECs6zIf3see6VA5TTFoN5o"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEBWoXIH0xmiQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0G6HoAs-/0/1744646484534?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=1xSPoVoUfdv7utgBQxGo2YNyAXHHHl58tOeEIJLAzZU"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF7DZzQbWErng/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0GVH0Ao-/0/1744646484649?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=3pQqjmeKDATfJQ_MqRwG5sLci4E7KrLVfE_GUdIOmUo"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFrK-FsBohd2Q/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0IOHQAk-/0/1744646485338?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=FDkpl5f6MzidsiR97bWdauTILUDoG8h3mvAmqAswYyA"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF-GqJHh0uZ4Q/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZY1B0GwGQAs-/0/1744646479983?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=tQU0E0JXZrFQhx594CeKQ3fkwyhbblugX2kIgVBIC4s"},{"url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF7eP-zeDB-2Q/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZY1B0HoHoAo-/0/1744646483345?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=Eo_fw8-Estk_PJiYPwI3DNDyv4eARS7yqSMi8VQBajw"}],"num_appreciations":3,"num_comments":12,"num_empathy":23,"num_likes":40,"num_praises":19,"num_reactions":85,"num_reposts":10,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7317652890205016065/","posted":"2025-04-14 21:00:04","poster":{"first":"Chrystal","headline":"I help people find their neon yellow thread in the sea of grey cloth.

Even when leadership changes. Even when service has its rough patches.\n\n ❌ They do leave when your product is ‘nice to have’ rather than mission-critical.\n\nYour SaaS startups needs to (1) reduce churn (2) maximize retention and (3) drive revenue expansion by ensuring Sales, CS, and Product are aligned around long-term customer impact.

Without a clear strategy for retention, even the most innovative products risk losing traction.\n\nBest practices are pointing to three critical considerations for SaaS founders right now:\n\n1️⃣ Customer Value is a Moving Target\nYour customers' needs shift as they scale. Are you evolving with them? Proactively engaging customers and refining onboarding ensures your product remains indispensable.\n\n2️⃣ Expansion Begins with Alignment\nRetention is not just Customer Success’s job, but instead is truly a team sport.

The goal? To step away from judgment and make choices anchored in “What is the best decision for this moment?”\n\nThis week, I caught up with a former customer I haven’t worked with in years. To me, one of the best professional compliments is staying connected with someone as a friend long after the work has ended. Our collaboration was always about more than the contract, the upgrade, the support issue, or the delayed product delivery. \n\nAt its core, it came down to transparency, honesty, owning mistakes, a sense of urgency, and a commitment to finding solutions. The same things we value in great people, not just great workers.\n\nI recently read a book that described life as “one big referral.” It struck me as profoundly true, especially when paired with the idea that “people will never forget how you made them feel.” We’re sometimes led to believe that the smile, the laugh, the joke, the pleasantries > the humanness < aren’t necessary for success. But my experience has shown me otherwise.\n\nDo such good work, in such a great way, that people will carry your name into rooms you’ve never entered. That they’ll think of you, not just for what you delivered, but for how you showed up. That long after the emails, meetings, and transactions fade, what remains is the trust, the connection, and the impact.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the best work is both about what you do AND who you are while doing it.","time":"4 months ago","urn":"7308155735450808323"},{"images":[],"num_appreciations":9,"num_comments":38,"num_empathy":24,"num_likes":211,"num_praises":22,"num_reactions":266,"num_reposts":24,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7307389409052536832/","posted":"2025-03-17 13:16:39","poster":{"first":"Kyle","headline":"Chief of Staff at Morning Brew Inc.","image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHoEgPI1bWxjQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1709171225152?e=1758153600&v=beta&t=rUG6CLHG43fzUOz8sJMVJ2B_X9L3Nk1NGJ8PFEAyths","last":"Hagge","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylehagge","public_id":"kylehagge","urn":"ACoAACxKzKIBYkv8OVWHCe3onDRLbuEyVs38EnY"},"poster_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylehagge","repost_stats":{"num_appreciations":9,"num_comments":38,"num_empathy":24,"num_interests":0,"num_likes":211,"num_maybe":0,"num_praises":22,"num_reactions":266,"num_reposts":24},"repost_urn":"7307431674319900672","reposted":"2025-03-17 16:04:36","reshared":true,"text":"COME WORK AT MORNING BREW: I want to call out specifically an Account Executive / Senior Account Executive open position our Professional Sales Team\n\nThis is an incredible team led by Siri Cosper.

I thought it would be super straightforward and easy, but one of the biggest lessons I'm learning is that quality experience truly matters—for both students and startups.\n\nFor students, they need an opportunity where they can actually land the job, do well, earn money, and make real connections that move their careers forward. So, my responsibility is to deliver an experience where they're connecting to exciting opportunities and feel supported with the right tools and resources to be successful on every project. \n\nFor startups, they need high-quality work, minimal friction, and tangible results.  This means we have to be rigorous in vetting student freelancers, making sure they're sharp, adaptable, and can handle both direction and ambiguity.

This whole process has made me take a step back and wonder what's really going on in the tech industry. \n\nI think we are in the infancy of a technological revolution. I am applying for all of these Jr Dev positions while also paying close attention to what is happening in the world of AI and I am coming to a stark realization lately. So here's my hot take on the situation:\n\nI believe that if you are in the same position as me (looking for your foot in the door as a Junior Dev), you should make learning AI and getting good at using it/building with it a priority. Gone are the days of chiseling out code line by line into an IDE. With the multitude of cutting edge tools at our disposal, it's only a matter of time before the old paradigm of \"Junior Developer\" looks completely different. AI can write code better, faster, and more efficiently than probably 90% of the people in my network, and it just keeps getting better the more we use it. \n\nWhen I look out into the future and really consider where we are headed as a society, it becomes pretty apparent to me that I am watching the job I am trying to get slowly die right before my eyes. So I figure that it might be time to scan the horizon for the next opportunity. This is tech, if you want to stay afloat, you have to get good or you're going to get surpassed by the person who is good at the new thing. That's how it's always been. So I have come to ask myself, \"Do you want to be the last of a dying breed or do you want to be at the very forefront of the cutting edge?\" \n\nJust some food for thought.

Woodruff, Director of Strategic Partnerships at mHUB , reminded us of the need to understand the regulatory hurdles that have the ability to impact progress. (See BIPA). Alongside co-host Matthew Louis, thank you both for fostering a thoughtful space grounded in community, learning, and presence.\n\nA few insights:\n\nElizabeth Barisik from Visier on agentic AI as a baseline for business and enterprise SaaS development — where data + context = the new moat. She emphasized the rapid growth of AI use behind the scenes, transforming ideas into tangible assets, way faster than we think.\n\nNickhil Tekwani- leading in product and Gen AI at McDonalds, shared how AI can drive customer feel-good moments through latency unlocks and improved experience connectivity.\n\nNate Carson shared insights on Uber’s AI adoption through the future of “human” work in enhancing AI models.\n\nChris Anderson’s story was truly inspiring. I love how he and his wife brought their children along their science and technology journey. What started with Lego kits contributed to an AI-powered global defense system!  He also invited us to demo his new product - Ai.rplane\n\nMakunde G. - building an amazing career and shared his journey to Google. He recommended book Algorithms of Oppression — a powerful reminder that algorithms can marginalize as easily as they can innovate. Makunde emphasizes community as the foundation for innovation for all.\n\nMichelangelo D'Agostino (Grainger) noted the need for net-new assets vs. retrofitting existing systems. He shared Grainger’s rich Chicago history and how it has led in innovation over the past nearly 100 years.\n\nCait Moran emphasized the human’s role in the future of AI, focused on emotionally intelligent design for autonomous digital teams. “Don’t teach tools. Teach decision-making.”\n\nBut my absolute favorite moment?\n🧠 Following the event, a deep, perspective-shifting conversation with Shawn HE YUXUN on quantum AI and the future of human utility when our “first-person view” begins to orbit around AI.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake?

Thanks to the host and presenters for a practical discussion with tangible takeaways for application right now. \"This is the age of the idea person\", where those without developer experience can build with tools like Replit.\n\nWED (6/11) – hosted by 1871, Tech for Good Innovation Week: ClimateTech Community Day at the Wild Mile by Urban Rivers - the world’s first floating eco-park located on the Chicago River. This was a timely, rescheduled conversation on local solutions, sustainability, and scaling tech for environmental change. \n\nTHU (6/12) – inspired by the amazing work of The Chicago Community Trust’s Young Leaders Fund (YLF), I came to congratulate Noma S., a 2025 grantee using tech to drive impact in youth development. A real reminder that innovation and equity go hand in hand. Congratulations to the 16 awardees! \nNoma is also Founder of Youth Sports Science Institute, where she employs an innovative approach that combines sports training with traditional STEM/STEAM instructional models.\n\nGrateful for the ideas, energy, and people shaping what’s next.

His model is flipping high hourly rates that create reduced access to legal counsel on their head. \n\nCommunity!\n\nIt is always good vibes when I catch up with Devin Tyler, Founder/CEO at Tenacity - https://lnkd.in/gSBSWTaS. In case you didn’t know, the next generation just clocked in! He’s working to match highly skilled college seniors and recent graduates to growing startups and businesses. Every student is vetted, trained, and ready to execute. Founders love the output and the costs stay reasonable. One platform to hire, manage, and get the work done. Post a project!\n\nJoe Cruz , Owner/Operator of Ava’s Italian Ice and Honey Bomb Elixirs (https://lnkd.in/guKncKyy), co-sponsored today’s event with samples of three signature elixir flavors.

It connects AI models, like large language models (LLMs), to various external data sources and tools.

ScaleUp 2025 offered growth-stage founders the insights, tools, connections, and discussions needed to move into the next phase of maturity for greater scale. Special thanks to BMO Tower for hosting us in their beautiful space.\n\nFor those who missed it or are curious about the types of discussions held (and my quick take):\n\nKeynote with 1871 CEO Betsy Ziegler and Alex Jones, CEO & Co-Founder Hallow.\nAlex shared the challenges of scaling the #1 Christian meditation and prayer app while keeping his spiritual focus strong as a mechanism to push through growing pains.\n\nScaling the Future of Smart Farming with Oishii.\nThis is seriously cool food tech. Oishii’s “beautiful taste” comes from perfect strawberries grown in a pesticide-free, climate-controlled, AI-enabled smart farming system. I can confirm they taste amazing :-)\n\nPanel: Innovating Without Breaking the Bank, led by Stuart Bernstein.\nIn this economic landscape, this was the news founders need. Topics included enabling innovation, fostering a culture of problem-solving, and strategies for experimenting and iterating, all while staying aligned with growth plans.\n\nPanel: The Future of Work & Investment, led by Angi Milano.\nLean scaling, organizational effectiveness, acceleration with AI as table stakes, the pros and cons of having a co-founder, and the evolution of investing through the VC lens.\n\nFireside chat with Betsy Z. and Wallace Harris, Jr., President at BMO Harris Investment Services.\nThe focus here was on building and investing in community as a mechanism for business growth and development—a powerful reminder that community-driven growth is real. Wallace also spoke on moving past the 'no' to find workable solutions.\n\nThe 1871 team truly delivers excellence at every single event. Their behind-the-scenes efforts are what make these experiences not just successful, but impactful. Major kudos to the team!\n\nGrateful for the community we’re building. I got to catch up with Chrystal Price and Daniel Hernandez, and made new connections with Alex Olson and Mellini Monique.","time":"2 months ago","urn":"7326379064296984576"},{"images":[],"num_appreciations":1,"num_comments":3,"num_empathy":10,"num_likes":17,"num_reactions":28,"num_reposts":0,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7325149776201613312/","posted":"2025-05-05 13:30:01","poster":{"first":"Krystal","headline":"📈 Fractional Ops + Customer Journey | Startup Consultant | Tech Equity","image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQE_3IPtzAe4rw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1709834412116?e=1758153600&v=beta&t=v3-kTdYdRjreH5ODiGclJ-f0emSAvVSIkAIOtVe26nQ","last":"Rogers","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalrogersminter","public_id":"krystalrogersminter","urn":"ACoAAAGf8bIBCs0GZ61wzix1Bg0LwjFZ-qVUcao"},"poster_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalrogersminter","reshared":false,"text":"My father is an entrepreneur. He’s 75 years old. One of my first memories of his designs is a glow in the dark gym shoe sent to Nike in the early 80s. He never heard back.\n\nAnother one of his many memorable ideas was “Brother Aids” in the late 80s, to introduce adhesive bandages for brown-skinned people.\n\nMy mother was an entrepreneur. She sold Queen’s Way clothing, Avon, Tupperware, Brown & Bigelow. I recall attending different home events.\n\nIn the late 80s they opened a t-shirt shop, selling a variety of heat-pressed and custom designs, plus my father was delivering custom spray painting designs. The business thrived. My sister worked there. My father began screen printing in the evenings, and they built to securing 1000+ item orders. I remember a lot of t-shirt folding!\n\nMy father later opened a cleaning business serving other businesses, employing family and friends.\n\nMy father worked full time as an electrician from 19 years old until retirement. He continued as a practicing electrician until his late 60s, including serving for several years as an electrician instructor.\n\nMy mother worked full time as a mental health physician’s assistant for many years. I would go to work with her sometimes, filing and calling the patients back to the doctor. Later she transitioned full time into the t-shirt business.\n\nSo, you can say that I was exposed early to building things from ideas as well as building dreams 'on the side'. \n\nThat’s why I favor startups, because I love the visionaries and doers who create tangible value at scale.\n\nCheers to those who have the nerve to build their dreams.\n\nP.S.

For two days, the space was alive with energy from AI and Web3 leaders, investors, and builders shaping the next wave of innovation. I chose the AI track — focused on how industries are navigating adoption at scale and where real impact lies.\n\nThere was so much to take in, but here’s a glimpse of what stuck with me:\n\nKeith Toney, EVP, Discover: Talked candidly about AI’s “change ceiling” — where layers of data access, organizational fear, and governance challenges can stall innovation. You have to recognize AI fear as real. Label it. Talk about it. Build the right sponsorship. And, only build things you can't buy.\n\nMatt Renner, who leads cybersecurity at Antares Capital, offered a powerful framework for thinking about effective AI implementation. He emphasized that true scale comes from repeatability — it’s not enough to have one-off wins; success hinges on consistent execution across use cases. He underscored the need for clear leadership alignment, warning that without top-down clarity, AI efforts often stall.\n\n\"AI in Academia - Transforming the Classroom and Beyond\"\nXiaochen Z., CEO, Fintech4Good: Co-hosted the day and led the panel that challenged us to think globally — policy, education, and ethics must shape responsible AI.\n< Aravinda Garimella, Professor, Gies\n I really enjoyed Aravinda's commentary and perspective on building the next generation of AI contributors and leaders. She's super committed to ensuring both tacit and explicit student knowledge. Aravinda raised and discussed a critical point: academia must evolve both ethically and technically to lead in the AI era. \n< David Zaretsky, PhD, Professor, Pritzker School of Law\nAmongst many areas of expertise, David teaches an amazing course on the evolution of AI and its ethical and legal considerations to law students at Northwestern - literally building the course in real-time to ensure the latest insights and updates are interwoven into student learning and understanding. I'd love to be invited to observe a class!\n\n\"Web3 & AI - A Real Conversation About Energy & Data cCenters\"\n< Amber Orr, Director of Engineering & Energy Services\n Through her breadth of industry knowledge, she so casually educated us about 'power factor', edge compute and power delivery. Amber reminded us that energy and infrastructure aren’t side notes but are truly at center stage in scalable AI. You gained a fan.\n\nHuge congrats to the AI startup pitch finalists:\nDeepNeed, Levee, MEGI Health, nutrād, Oraczen — bold ideas, sharp execution! I'm rooting for you all.\n\nI'm always grateful for new conversations, so thanks to Noma S., Rob Wellen, MSIM, and Kyree Blount — let’s keep building.\n\nAs always, thank you Betsy Ziegler and the incredible 1871 team for a fitting finale at the Mart — and the spark for what’s next.\n\nYou can't grow community without showing up.

Maybe.\n\nHere are 5 signals that prove it isn’t (and what to do ASAP):\n\n1. No clear #ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).\n → Fix it: Segment current users, identify your most successful customers, and build your messaging and roadmap around them.\n\n2. #Growth is driven solely by new logos.\n → Fix it: Build expansion paths into the product experience and train teams to spot growth triggers early.\n\n3. Customers aren’t reaching 'true' #activation.\n → Fix it: Map the customer journey, define Time-to-Value (TTV), and simplify onboarding before acquiring more users.\n\n4. Sales, Customer Success, and Product are misaligned.\n → Fix it: Create shared success metrics across functions and establish regular cross-functional syncs.\n\n5. Churn is treated as a customer support problem.\n → Fix it: Build a proactive retention system—health scoring, feedback loops, and early renewal playbooks.\n\nScaling a SaaS company isn’t easy, but it is doable.\nThe path forward is about growing smart. This means alignment across teams, clear operational strategy, and relentless focus on delivering measurable value.\n\nTake some time to reflect.

Even when leadership changes. Even when service has its rough patches.\n\n ❌ They do leave when your product is ‘nice to have’ rather than mission-critical.\n\nYour SaaS startups needs to (1) reduce churn (2) maximize retention and (3) drive revenue expansion by ensuring Sales, CS, and Product are aligned around long-term customer impact.

Are you evolving with them? Proactively engaging customers and refining onboarding ensures your product remains indispensable.\n\n2️⃣ Expansion Begins with Alignment\nRetention is not just Customer Success’s job, but instead is truly a team sport.

The goal? To step away from judgment and make choices anchored in “What is the best decision for this moment?”\n\nThis week, I caught up with a former customer I haven’t worked with in years. To me, one of the best professional compliments is staying connected with someone as a friend long after the work has ended. Our collaboration was always about more than the contract, the upgrade, the support issue, or the delayed product delivery. \n\nAt its core, it came down to transparency, honesty, owning mistakes, a sense of urgency, and a commitment to finding solutions. The same things we value in great people, not just great workers.\n\nI recently read a book that described life as “one big referral.” It struck me as profoundly true, especially when paired with the idea that “people will never forget how you made them feel.” We’re sometimes led to believe that the smile, the laugh, the joke, the pleasantries > the humanness < aren’t necessary for success. But my experience has shown me otherwise.\n\nDo such good work, in such a great way, that people will carry your name into rooms you’ve never entered. That they’ll think of you, not just for what you delivered, but for how you showed up. That long after the emails, meetings, and transactions fade, what remains is the trust, the connection, and the impact.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the best work is both about what you do AND who you are while doing it.","time":"4 months ago","urn":"7308155735450808323"},{"images":[],"num_appreciations":9,"num_comments":38,"num_empathy":24,"num_likes":211,"num_praises":22,"num_reactions":266,"num_reposts":24,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7307389409052536832/","posted":"2025-03-17 13:16:39","poster":{"first":"Kyle","headline":"Chief of Staff at Morning Brew Inc.","image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHoEgPI1bWxjQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1709171225152?e=1758153600&v=beta&t=rUG6CLHG43fzUOz8sJMVJ2B_X9L3Nk1NGJ8PFEAyths","last":"Hagge","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylehagge","public_id":"kylehagge","urn":"ACoAACxKzKIBYkv8OVWHCe3onDRLbuEyVs38EnY"},"poster_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylehagge","repost_stats":{"num_appreciations":9,"num_comments":38,"num_empathy":24,"num_interests":0,"num_likes":211,"num_maybe":0,"num_praises":22,"num_reactions":266,"num_reposts":24},"repost_urn":"7307431674319900672","reposted":"2025-03-17 16:04:36","reshared":true,"text":"COME WORK AT MORNING BREW: I want to call out specifically an Account Executive / Senior Account Executive open position our Professional Sales Team\n\nThis is an incredible team led by Siri Cosper.

I thought it would be super straightforward and easy, but one of the biggest lessons I'm learning is that quality experience truly matters—for both students and startups.\n\nFor students, they need an opportunity where they can actually land the job, do well, earn money, and make real connections that move their careers forward. So, my responsibility is to deliver an experience where they're connecting to exciting opportunities and feel supported with the right tools and resources to be successful on every project. \n\nFor startups, they need high-quality work, minimal friction, and tangible results.  This means we have to be rigorous in vetting student freelancers, making sure they're sharp, adaptable, and can handle both direction and ambiguity. Founders don't have time for hand-holding—they need work that's efficient and impactful. \n\nIt's a balancing act for sure, but if we get it right, the experience on both sides will be game-changing.\n\nSo, if you know top-tier college Juniors or Seniors who would thrive in a startup gig, send them our way. They can apply using the link.\n\nShoutout to Lake Forest College, Ball State University, and Northwestern University—we’re already working with some of your best marketing and tech students.\n\nWe’re on our way to something big—one startup and one student at a time… lol, sorry, that was corny, but it feels right as I type this out on a sunny Chicago day.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gH-T9e94","time":"4 months ago","urn":"7305565746040868864"},{"images":[],"num_comments":1,"num_empathy":1,"num_interests":1,"num_likes":8,"num_reactions":10,"num_reposts":1,"post_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7305243389061386242/","posted":"2025-03-11 15:09:08","poster":{"first":"Krystal","headline":"📈 Fractional Ops + Customer Journey | Startup Consultant | Tech Equity","image_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQE_3IPtzAe4rw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1709834412116?e=1758153600&v=beta&t=v3-kTdYdRjreH5ODiGclJ-f0emSAvVSIkAIOtVe26nQ","last":"Rogers","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalrogersminter","public_id":"krystalrogersminter","urn":"ACoAAAGf8bIBCs0GZ61wzix1Bg0LwjFZ-qVUcao"},"poster_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalrogersminter","reshared":false,"text":"Most retention playbooks fail because they treat churn as a Customer Success problem.\n\nAfter founding and scaling customer operations for two SaaS startups that successfully exited, I learned that when customers quit a company it isn’t just about how well a customer success team supports users; it’s about the entire customer journey.\n\nIf retention is slipping, the issue is rarely isolated to CS.

This whole process has made me take a step back and wonder what's really going on in the tech industry. \n\nI think we are in the infancy of a technological revolution. I am applying for all of these Jr Dev positions while also paying close attention to what is happening in the world of AI and I am coming to a stark realization lately. So here's my hot take on the situation:\n\nI believe that if you are in the same position as me (looking for your foot in the door as a Junior Dev), you should make learning AI and getting good at using it/building with it a priority. Gone are the days of chiseling out code line by line into an IDE. With the multitude of cutting edge tools at our disposal, it's only a matter of time before the old paradigm of \"Junior Developer\" looks completely different. AI can write code better, faster, and more efficiently than probably 90% of the people in my network, and it just keeps getting better the more we use it. \n\nWhen I look out into the future and really consider where we are headed as a society, it becomes pretty apparent to me that I am watching the job I am trying to get slowly die right before my eyes. So I figure that it might be time to scan the horizon for the next opportunity. This is tech, if you want to stay afloat, you have to get good or you're going to get surpassed by the person who is good at the new thing. That's how it's always been. So I have come to ask myself, \"Do you want to be the last of a dying breed or do you want to be at the very forefront of the cutting edge?\" \n\nJust some food for thought.

Woodruff, Director of Strategic Partnerships at mHUB , reminded us of the need to understand the regulatory hurdles that have the ability to impact progress. (See BIPA). Alongside co-host Matthew Louis, thank you both for fostering a thoughtful space grounded in community, learning, and presence.\n\nA few insights:\n\nElizabeth Barisik from Visier on agentic AI as a baseline for business and enterprise SaaS development — where data + context = the new moat. She emphasized the rapid growth of AI use behind the scenes, transforming ideas into tangible assets, way faster than we think.\n\nNickhil Tekwani- leading in product and Gen AI at McDonalds, shared how AI can drive customer feel-good moments through latency unlocks and improved experience connectivity.\n\nNate Carson shared insights on Uber’s AI adoption through the future of “human” work in enhancing AI models.\n\nChris Anderson’s story was truly inspiring. I love how he and his wife brought their children along their science and technology journey. What started with Lego kits contributed to an AI-powered global defense system!  He also invited us to demo his new product - Ai.rplane\n\nMakunde G. - building an amazing career and shared his journey to Google. He recommended book Algorithms of Oppression — a powerful reminder that algorithms can marginalize as easily as they can innovate. Makunde emphasizes community as the foundation for innovation for all.\n\nMichelangelo D'Agostino (Grainger) noted the need for net-new assets vs. retrofitting existing systems. He shared Grainger’s rich Chicago history and how it has led in innovation over the past nearly 100 years.\n\nCait Moran emphasized the human’s role in the future of AI, focused on emotionally intelligent design for autonomous digital teams. “Don’t teach tools. Teach decision-making.”\n\nBut my absolute favorite moment?\n🧠 Following the event, a deep, perspective-shifting conversation with Shawn HE YUXUN on quantum AI and the future of human utility when our “first-person view” begins to orbit around AI.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake? I got to share the experience with my wonderful sister Kymberley R. ❤️</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-06-25 18:17:50</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF0G4Uwc45W0w/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZeoT2b3GoAk-/0/1750875467266?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=EIhLA3HzXJM4aX-KnA9f9y_zD_lkqAA0N-SFC4_zClY\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7343703988325728257/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>🌞 Hey Chicago builders and dreamers, the first rule of success is showing up!

Thanks to the host and presenters for a practical discussion with tangible takeaways for application right now. \"This is the age of the idea person\", where those without developer experience can build with tools like Replit.\n\nWED (6/11) – hosted by 1871, Tech for Good Innovation Week: ClimateTech Community Day at the Wild Mile by Urban Rivers - the world’s first floating eco-park located on the Chicago River. This was a timely, rescheduled conversation on local solutions, sustainability, and scaling tech for environmental change. \n\nTHU (6/12) – inspired by the amazing work of The Chicago Community Trust’s Young Leaders Fund (YLF), I came to congratulate Noma S., a 2025 grantee using tech to drive impact in youth development. A real reminder that innovation and equity go hand in hand. Congratulations to the 16 awardees! \nNoma is also Founder of Youth Sports Science Institute, where she employs an innovative approach that combines sports training with traditional STEM/STEAM instructional models.\n\nGrateful for the ideas, energy, and people shaping what’s next.

An atmosphere alive with curiosity, we were inspired by unknowns to create the clarity that fueled progress.\n\nWell, I’ll be, because I felt that very energy at 1 Million Cups Chicago’s event this week. Founders baring it all to share their startup babies and trusting the community to question and challenge their ideas and thinking, and offer advice.\n\nThank you to the 1MC Chicago team for a wonderfully curated setting to help bring great ideas to fruition.\n\nThis week’s presenters:\n\nDiane Moca, Founder/CEO of MomSub - https://www.momsub.com/ - Diane is a serial entrepreneur redefining access to a quality, reliable, on-demand child care provider for working moms and families. The company growth and trajectory are amazing, and she’s looking for companies ready to bring this child care clarity as a benefit to their employees.\n\nMathew Kerbis of Law Subscribed (https://lnkd.in/gmzeGnbd) is an attorney and podcast host bringing subscription-based legal services to growing startups and businesses. His model is flipping high hourly rates that create reduced access to legal counsel on their head. \n\nCommunity!\n\nIt is always good vibes when I catch up with Devin Tyler, Founder/CEO at Tenacity - https://lnkd.in/gSBSWTaS. In case you didn’t know, the next generation just clocked in! He’s working to match highly skilled college seniors and recent graduates to growing startups and businesses. Every student is vetted, trained, and ready to execute. Founders love the output and the costs stay reasonable. One platform to hire, manage, and get the work done. Post a project!\n\nJoe Cruz , Owner/Operator of Ava’s Italian Ice and Honey Bomb Elixirs (https://lnkd.in/guKncKyy), co-sponsored today’s event with samples of three signature elixir flavors. Honey Bomb Elixirs are a powerful mix of several ingredients like lemon, ginger, and garlic that work together to kickstart your body's immune system. The flavors roll out in LAYERS. They are truly delicious, made with local, 100% organic and raw honey without any additives, color enhancers, or artificial flavors.\n\nSeveral familiar faces: Daniel Hernandez (co-host), Arliss Banks (co-host), Cecilia Benitez, and Joanna Drew!\n\nI didn’t get a chance to formally meet our dynamic host Stuart Bernstein, but surely next time!\n\nHave I ever mentioned how superb the Chicago startup community is? 😉</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-06-05 13:30:09</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEqyQ-2jDB5Jg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56Zc94mFrHoAk-/0/1749089938578?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=vADgqEHuI-4uzsN8EWkvV9aqWm_x8o1F-QAG_PGKJDU\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336383836005552128/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>It’s not too late to apply for 1871’s BLKtech Founders program, designed specifically to support Black entrepreneurs in growing their innovative businesses.

It connects AI models, like large language models (LLMs), to various external data sources and tools. Developed by Anthropic.\n> MCP servers act like modular, authenticated data sources.\n> MCP terminals can index a group of MCP servers, which can be chained together.\n> Agents communicate across the created network using permissioned protocols.\n> MCPs reduce siloing by enabling shared memory and interoperability.\n> Real-world use cases: ETL automation, secure data retrieval, autonomous workflows.\n> Integration with MCP is growing; Google announced adoption last month.

He spoke about the need for broad transformation, citing data interoperability as a true measure of evolution. His great energy coupled with deep expertise provided a great atmosphere for all voices to be included in the conversation.\n\nI can never go too far without thanking the 1871 team. Familiar faces were  Billy N. and Joey, program managers who always help ensure great event experiences.\n\nAlways great to catch up with tech community members. I just love the Chicago startup landscape. ♥️</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-05-23 17:45:18</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQESftlXvhgg6w/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56Zb.P69sH4Ak-/0/1748022312864?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=ifQyiCVif7WEdW8ne_nFLCA2E8LqhhHnmSW69gjmPVk\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331737003757125632/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>The last few weeks have been quietly powerful.\n\nUnexpected introductions turned into one-on-one strategic conversations with founders across industries like food and beverage, wearable tech, SaaS data tools, and startup acceleration. These folks are passionate, curious, thoughtful, and mission-driven people building things that matter. \n\nSome of those conversations turned into collaborations. Some into customers. \n\nAnd every one expressed real value received.\n\nThere’s a quote I keep coming back to:\n“It’ll look like nothing until it looks like everything.”\n\nAnd right now, it’s starting to look like something :-)\n\nGrateful. Energized.

ScaleUp 2025 offered growth-stage founders the insights, tools, connections, and discussions needed to move into the next phase of maturity for greater scale. Special thanks to BMO Tower for hosting us in their beautiful space.\n\nFor those who missed it or are curious about the types of discussions held (and my quick take):\n\nKeynote with 1871 CEO Betsy Ziegler and Alex Jones, CEO & Co-Founder Hallow.\nAlex shared the challenges of scaling the #1 Christian meditation and prayer app while keeping his spiritual focus strong as a mechanism to push through growing pains.\n\nScaling the Future of Smart Farming with Oishii.\nThis is seriously cool food tech. Oishii’s “beautiful taste” comes from perfect strawberries grown in a pesticide-free, climate-controlled, AI-enabled smart farming system. I can confirm they taste amazing :-)\n\nPanel: Innovating Without Breaking the Bank, led by Stuart Bernstein.\nIn this economic landscape, this was the news founders need. Topics included enabling innovation, fostering a culture of problem-solving, and strategies for experimenting and iterating, all while staying aligned with growth plans.\n\nPanel: The Future of Work & Investment, led by Angi Milano.\nLean scaling, organizational effectiveness, acceleration with AI as table stakes, the pros and cons of having a co-founder, and the evolution of investing through the VC lens.\n\nFireside chat with Betsy Z. and Wallace Harris, Jr., President at BMO Harris Investment Services.\nThe focus here was on building and investing in community as a mechanism for business growth and development—a powerful reminder that community-driven growth is real. Wallace also spoke on moving past the 'no' to find workable solutions.\n\nThe 1871 team truly delivers excellence at every single event. Their behind-the-scenes efforts are what make these experiences not just successful, but impactful. Major kudos to the team!\n\nGrateful for the community we’re building. I got to catch up with Chrystal Price and Daniel Hernandez, and made new connections with Alex Olson and Mellini Monique.</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-05-08 22:54:46</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFZd3QHwjJC4Q/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZayG6ojHgAk-/0/1746744883109?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=9MVZoa-K_Mjc_wiSHpa7bbbjJlcXGmwKqba5NSvkhdA\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7326379064296984576/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>My father is an entrepreneur. He’s 75 years old. One of my first memories of his designs is a glow in the dark gym shoe sent to Nike in the early 80s. He never heard back.\n\nAnother one of his many memorable ideas was “Brother Aids” in the late 80s, to introduce adhesive bandages for brown-skinned people.\n\nMy mother was an entrepreneur. She sold Queen’s Way clothing, Avon, Tupperware, Brown & Bigelow. I recall attending different home events.\n\nIn the late 80s they opened a t-shirt shop, selling a variety of heat-pressed and custom designs, plus my father was delivering custom spray painting designs. The business thrived. My sister worked there. My father began screen printing in the evenings, and they built to securing 1000+ item orders. I remember a lot of t-shirt folding!\n\nMy father later opened a cleaning business serving other businesses, employing family and friends.\n\nMy father worked full time as an electrician from 19 years old until retirement. He continued as a practicing electrician until his late 60s, including serving for several years as an electrician instructor.\n\nMy mother worked full time as a mental health physician’s assistant for many years. I would go to work with her sometimes, filing and calling the patients back to the doctor. Later she transitioned full time into the t-shirt business.\n\nSo, you can say that I was exposed early to building things from ideas as well as building dreams 'on the side'. \n\nThat’s why I favor startups, because I love the visionaries and doers who create tangible value at scale.\n\nCheers to those who have the nerve to build their dreams.\n\nP.S. My father is finalizing a patent for a new product. I’ll be sure to share when he’s ready. ♥️</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-05-05 13:30:01</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7325149776201613312/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>The Catch-22. The Gift and the Curse. The Rock and a Hard Place.\n\nYou really don’t want your customers describing your B2B SaaS startup like this.\n\nBut it happens when... \n} The product is sticky but clunky.\n} When switching feels painful, but staying isn’t delivering value.\n} When teams are “managing through it,” but not seeing outcomes.\n\nThat’s not loyalty. That’s resignation. And it’s a churn risk waiting to materialize.\n\n🚫 You don’t want to be “too embedded to leave”\n✅ You want to be “too valuable to lose”\n\nSo how do you avoid becoming the necessary evil in someone’s tech stack?\n\n1️⃣ Obsess over Time-to-Value (TTV)\n2️⃣ Align Product, Sales, and CS around customer outcomes\n3️⃣ Ask hard questions early: “Would you buy this again today?”\n\nCustomer relationships built on perceived pain are brittle.\n\nValue-first relationships are built to grow.\n\nWhere does your product sit today? Is it a necessary evil or essential solution?\n#B2BSaaS #CustomerSuccess #Retention #Growth #SaaSLeadership #ProductStrategy #SaaSFounders</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-04-28 13:30:08</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGWwnGebnkmiw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZZoxpGIH4As-/0/1745514567035?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=qdx6d-VRCffTC0Wa8w1qozc28uRHn9nGkT_S30bkrS4\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322613092331233280/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>Here’s the hard truth: growth doesn’t happen until your product seamlessly solves real pain points for your ideal customers.\n\nIf that’s not happening yet, here are a few usual suspects:\n\n(1) You built before deeply understanding your ICP. Always a no-no to build before the customer need can be articulated.\n\n(2) You haven’t talked to enough customers who match your ICP. Generic conversations with people willing to talk to you don't count.\n\n(3) Your product solves only part of the problem. Perhaps it’s too slow, buggy, or unclear. \n\nThis is the moment to take a breath. Then take a step back.\n\nYou can’t fake traction. But you can gain it with clarity.\n\nStart by setting one simple goal:\n>> Talk to 15 customers within your ICP within the next week.\n\nAsk better questions. Listen for patterns. Revisit your assumptions.\n>> Then: research, reflect, refine.\n\nWhat might you learn, about your customers or your product, if you truly listened with nothing to prove? 🤔\n__\n#B2BSaaS #SaaSGrowth #NRR #Retention #StartupOperations #CustomerExperience #Fractional #Product</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-04-24 16:51:18</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7321214164104888320/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 😉\n\nFor over 15 years, in every company I’ve worked with, my loyalty always found its way back to one place: the customer.\n\nNot at the expense of the business—never that.

For two days, the space was alive with energy from AI and Web3 leaders, investors, and builders shaping the next wave of innovation. I chose the AI track — focused on how industries are navigating adoption at scale and where real impact lies.\n\nThere was so much to take in, but here’s a glimpse of what stuck with me:\n\nKeith Toney, EVP, Discover: Talked candidly about AI’s “change ceiling” — where layers of data access, organizational fear, and governance challenges can stall innovation. You have to recognize AI fear as real. Label it. Talk about it. Build the right sponsorship. And, only build things you can't buy.\n\nMatt Renner, who leads cybersecurity at Antares Capital, offered a powerful framework for thinking about effective AI implementation. He emphasized that true scale comes from repeatability — it’s not enough to have one-off wins; success hinges on consistent execution across use cases. He underscored the need for clear leadership alignment, warning that without top-down clarity, AI efforts often stall.\n\n\"AI in Academia - Transforming the Classroom and Beyond\"\nXiaochen Z., CEO, Fintech4Good: Co-hosted the day and led the panel that challenged us to think globally — policy, education, and ethics must shape responsible AI.\n< Aravinda Garimella, Professor, Gies\n I really enjoyed Aravinda's commentary and perspective on building the next generation of AI contributors and leaders. She's super committed to ensuring both tacit and explicit student knowledge. Aravinda raised and discussed a critical point: academia must evolve both ethically and technically to lead in the AI era. \n< David Zaretsky, PhD, Professor, Pritzker School of Law\nAmongst many areas of expertise, David teaches an amazing course on the evolution of AI and its ethical and legal considerations to law students at Northwestern - literally building the course in real-time to ensure the latest insights and updates are interwoven into student learning and understanding. I'd love to be invited to observe a class!\n\n\"Web3 & AI - A Real Conversation About Energy & Data cCenters\"\n< Amber Orr, Director of Engineering & Energy Services\n Through her breadth of industry knowledge, she so casually educated us about 'power factor', edge compute and power delivery. Amber reminded us that energy and infrastructure aren’t side notes but are truly at center stage in scalable AI. You gained a fan.\n\nHuge congrats to the AI startup pitch finalists:\nDeepNeed, Levee, MEGI Health, nutrād, Oraczen — bold ideas, sharp execution! I'm rooting for you all.\n\nI'm always grateful for new conversations, so thanks to Noma S., Rob Wellen, MSIM, and Kyree Blount — let’s keep building.\n\nAs always, thank you Betsy Ziegler and the incredible 1871 team for a fitting finale at the Mart — and the spark for what’s next.\n\nYou can't grow community without showing up.

Maybe.\n\nHere are 5 signals that prove it isn’t (and what to do ASAP):\n\n1. No clear #ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).\n → Fix it: Segment current users, identify your most successful customers, and build your messaging and roadmap around them.\n\n2. #Growth is driven solely by new logos.\n → Fix it: Build expansion paths into the product experience and train teams to spot growth triggers early.\n\n3. Customers aren’t reaching 'true' #activation.\n → Fix it: Map the customer journey, define Time-to-Value (TTV), and simplify onboarding before acquiring more users.\n\n4. Sales, Customer Success, and Product are misaligned.\n → Fix it: Create shared success metrics across functions and establish regular cross-functional syncs.\n\n5. Churn is treated as a customer support problem.\n → Fix it: Build a proactive retention system—health scoring, feedback loops, and early renewal playbooks.\n\nScaling a SaaS company isn’t easy, but it is doable.\nThe path forward is about growing smart. This means alignment across teams, clear operational strategy, and relentless focus on delivering measurable value.\n\nTake some time to reflect. Are you building the set of systems to make your company sustainable?\n--\n#B2BSaaS #Fractional #CustomerSuccess #Retention #Startups #RevenueGrowth #CustomerExperience #SaaSAlignment #Leadership #ScaleSmarter #Founders #VCSaaS</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-04-16 13:30:03</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318264413919092738/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>We had 104 registrants for the #EdTech TechWalk.

If I had $1 for every customer that churned when the solution solved their key problems, I’d have exactly $0.\n\nWhy? Because true retention isn’t just about satisfaction; it’s about undeniable, ongoing value.\n\n✅ Customers don’t leave when they see your solution as essential. Even when budgets tighten. Even when leadership changes. Even when service has its rough patches.\n\n ❌ They do leave when your product is ‘nice to have’ rather than mission-critical.\n\nYour SaaS startups needs to (1) reduce churn (2) maximize retention and (3) drive revenue expansion by ensuring Sales, CS, and Product are aligned around long-term customer impact. Because the best growth strategy is keeping the customers you already have.\n\nHow is your company ensuring customers are finding value, now and progressively over time?

Without a clear strategy for retention, even the most innovative products risk losing traction.\n\nBest practices are pointing to three critical considerations for SaaS founders right now:\n\n1️⃣ Customer Value is a Moving Target\nYour customers' needs shift as they scale. Are you evolving with them? Proactively engaging customers and refining onboarding ensures your product remains indispensable.\n\n2️⃣ Expansion Begins with Alignment\nRetention is not just Customer Success’s job, but instead is truly a team sport. Aligning Sales, CS, and Product around a shared customer journey unlocks expansion and improves NRR.\n\n3️⃣ Data Should Drive Every Decision\nGut instinct isn’t enough. Companies that analyze usage patterns, customer feedback, and renewal risks outperform their peers.

The goal? To step away from judgment and make choices anchored in “What is the best decision for this moment?”\n\nThis week, I caught up with a former customer I haven’t worked with in years. To me, one of the best professional compliments is staying connected with someone as a friend long after the work has ended. Our collaboration was always about more than the contract, the upgrade, the support issue, or the delayed product delivery. \n\nAt its core, it came down to transparency, honesty, owning mistakes, a sense of urgency, and a commitment to finding solutions. The same things we value in great people, not just great workers.\n\nI recently read a book that described life as “one big referral.” It struck me as profoundly true, especially when paired with the idea that “people will never forget how you made them feel.” We’re sometimes led to believe that the smile, the laugh, the joke, the pleasantries > the humanness < aren’t necessary for success. But my experience has shown me otherwise.\n\nDo such good work, in such a great way, that people will carry your name into rooms you’ve never entered. That they’ll think of you, not just for what you delivered, but for how you showed up. That long after the emails, meetings, and transactions fade, what remains is the trust, the connection, and the impact.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the best work is both about what you do AND who you are while doing it.</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-03-19 16:01:46</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308155735450808323/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>COME WORK AT MORNING BREW: I want to call out specifically an Account Executive / Senior Account Executive open position our Professional Sales Team\n\nThis is an incredible team led by Siri Cosper.

I thought it would be super straightforward and easy, but one of the biggest lessons I'm learning is that quality experience truly matters—for both students and startups.\n\nFor students, they need an opportunity where they can actually land the job, do well, earn money, and make real connections that move their careers forward. So, my responsibility is to deliver an experience where they're connecting to exciting opportunities and feel supported with the right tools and resources to be successful on every project. \n\nFor startups, they need high-quality work, minimal friction, and tangible results.  This means we have to be rigorous in vetting student freelancers, making sure they're sharp, adaptable, and can handle both direction and ambiguity. Founders don't have time for hand-holding—they need work that's efficient and impactful. \n\nIt's a balancing act for sure, but if we get it right, the experience on both sides will be game-changing.\n\nSo, if you know top-tier college Juniors or Seniors who would thrive in a startup gig, send them our way. They can apply using the link.\n\nShoutout to Lake Forest College, Ball State University, and Northwestern University—we’re already working with some of your best marketing and tech students.\n\nWe’re on our way to something big—one startup and one student at a time… lol, sorry, that was corny, but it feels right as I type this out on a sunny Chicago day.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gH-T9e94</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-03-12 12:30:04</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7305565746040868864/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>Most retention playbooks fail because they treat churn as a Customer Success problem.\n\nAfter founding and scaling customer operations for two SaaS startups that successfully exited, I learned that when customers quit a company it isn’t just about how well a customer success team supports users; it’s about the entire customer journey.\n\nIf retention is slipping, the issue is rarely isolated to CS. The big picture tells a different story.\n\nAt first, I focused on the customer-facing team aligning structures, goals, and processes. But over time, one truth became impossible to ignore:\n\nSome of the biggest retention opportunities/challenges start long before CS has a chance to intervene.\n\n >> Sales sets the promise.\n >> Product delivers the promise.\n >> Customer Success activates the customer and ensures they realize the value.\n\nWhen these three teams aren’t in sync, even the best CS strategy won’t move the needle on churn.\n\nSales overpromises? \n>>>>Customers will disengage when the product doesn’t match expectations.\n\nProduct builds in a silo? \n>>>>CS can’t deliver success without the right features and workflows.\n\nCS isn’t aligned? \n>>>>Activation slows, and customers struggle to realize value quickly.\n\nRetention isn’t a CS problem—it’s a Revenue Operations problem.\n\nThe fastest-growing SaaS startups operationalize the relationship between Sales, Product, and CS to drive sustainable revenue growth. If you’re seeing churn, slow expansion, or low activation, the first step is mapping out where these teams AREN'T aligned.\n\n👉 Are these teams working together in your org, or just working NEAR each other?\n--\n#SaaS #retention #revenueoperations #founders #customersuccess #product #sales #growth #alignment</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-03-11 15:09:08</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7305243389061386242/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>Many consulting firms focus only on customer success or only on revenue operations—KVC bridges the gap between customer retention, revenue efficiency, and operational scale.\n\n1️⃣ Retention-First Approach – Unlike generic growth consulting, KVC optimizes revenue by fixing retention first. Churn reduction is the biggest unlock for ARR growth.\n\n2️⃣ Cross-Team Alignment (Sales, CS, & Product) – We don't just improve customer success; we ensure sales, CS, and product are working together to drive retention and expansion.\n\n3️⃣ Early-Stage SaaS Expertise – Many consulting firms focus on post-Series B growth.

The signs weren’t obvious. The customer seemed fine. So what went wrong?\n\nChurn rarely happens overnight. And the larger the contract, the less likely the customer will churn. Disengagement starts long before the cancellation notice. Maybe onboarding was too slow. Maybe expectations weren’t aligned. Maybe product adoption never took off. \n\nThe undeniable truth: Companies stick with and find the funds to pay for software they value.\n\nIf cancellations keep happening, the real question is what early signals did we miss?\n__\nhttps://lnkd.in/gjZc9t67\n__\n#RevenueOps #Retention #B2BSaaS #ScalingSmart #ChurnReduction #KeepYourCustomers #Founders #VCSaaS</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2025-02-27 14:58:29</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300892054564352002/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>A power-packed day at 1871 celebrating the critical business contributions of women around the world.

Within 2 years the game had over 30 million active users in the US. The world has never been the same since. The creator of Pac-Man, Toru Iwatani set out with one simple goal — to create a game that makes people happy. \n\nA few years ago, I put together an innovation summit for our local chamber and decided to wear this Pac-Man suit. A number of people told me the suit was inappropriate & ridiculous. Fortunately, I didn’t wear the suit for them….I wore it because I believe innovation is powered by fun, whimsy, and curiosity. \n\nI’m grateful that today at Lab22c I get to support #founders #funders #institutions who dream big & work tirelessly to solve problems to make a better world (all the while ignoring the naysayers!)\n\n #pacman 🚀</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2022-10-10 23:58:07</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E22AQEXMv6TcXDjgA/feedshare-shrink_1280/feedshare-shrink_1280/0/1665446286233?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=JPofxzv3HWpKso0s0JMpiW0esa8Gc7uGnsLptlUSxg0\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985388025115475968/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>Mixed Reality developer events by VRARA  association:\n\nMagic Leap 2 Hands On \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eEuEhM4T\n\nMetaVRse CEO Alan Smithson\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ePkVjMrr\n\nHalo (XBox) Producer & Microsoft  Education GM\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/emDvVvz9\n\n #education #developer #metaverse Unity</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2022-09-22 14:04:27</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6978715640790405120/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>We’re excited to announce the promotion of Reshma Dhawan to Lead Job Coach.\n\nMeet Reshma: Her journey to auticon began when she had a passion for Community Based Instruction and how it could lead to better career outcomes for adults on the autism spectrum. Her curiosity led her to become a Job Coach at auticon in 2020, after a long career as a special education teacher. Today, she works with our clients, autistic consulting teams, and technology managers to better support one another and achieve our goals.\n\nIn her new role, Reshma will be leading her Job Coaching team with an emphasis on new training and professional development opportunities. Additionally, she’ll collaborate with auticon’s global coaching teams to share best practices and new support services. \n\n“The Job Coach position acts kind of as a bridge between everyone. Being a Job Coach has been the best job title that I have ever held,” Reshma said. \n\nCatch Reshma on stage at the 2022 TASH Conference in December, hosted by TASH: Equity, Opportunity, and Inclusion for People with Disabilities Since 1975.</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2022-09-21 20:23:20</em></p>\n          <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E22AQGdgYCwpKS8vA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1663791798982?e=1755734400&v=beta&t=d1LWOs_lpB-2CxU9hfDurSmxYYXbheEDXS-0Dkl6oys\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" />\n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6978448602146689025/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>TECHPalooza 2022\nFriday, December 9th, 2022: 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST\nMuseum of Discovery and Science, Ft.

Most of the time I'm able to reply their questions but sometimes the question is about a very niche detail that I would easily solve by a small research and sometimes they just pronounce something I already know differently and we can't properly communicate. \n\nIn my latest interview with Turkish Airlines, interviewer asked me about \"event loops\" in Javascript and I never heard this name before; but then when I research I found that this is what I've been already using for 12 years of my career 😂 \n\nI would suggest all interviewers to minimize knowledge questions and try to test flexibility and eagerness of learning skills instead, especially for senior level developers. Let people use the internet during the interview for example, observe if they can solve your problem. You'll need a challenging problem of course to make it worth for researching.\n\n#interview #talent #softwaredevelopment</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2024-06-19 09:40:01</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209127779454377985/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>Congrats to the G.O.A.T! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g32xxzQP\n\n#esports #gaming</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2024-05-24 09:37:30</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199705059809480705/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>“I want every parent in the region to feel comfortable letting their kids come downtown,” noted our new President and CEO, Prema Katari Gupta.

This whole process has made me take a step back and wonder what's really going on in the tech industry. \n\nI think we are in the infancy of a technological revolution. I am applying for all of these Jr Dev positions while also paying close attention to what is happening in the world of AI and I am coming to a stark realization lately. So here's my hot take on the situation:\n\nI believe that if you are in the same position as me (looking for your foot in the door as a Junior Dev), you should make learning AI and getting good at using it/building with it a priority. Gone are the days of chiseling out code line by line into an IDE. With the multitude of cutting edge tools at our disposal, it's only a matter of time before the old paradigm of \"Junior Developer\" looks completely different. AI can write code better, faster, and more efficiently than probably 90% of the people in my network, and it just keeps getting better the more we use it. \n\nWhen I look out into the future and really consider where we are headed as a society, it becomes pretty apparent to me that I am watching the job I am trying to get slowly die right before my eyes. So I figure that it might be time to scan the horizon for the next opportunity. This is tech, if you want to stay afloat, you have to get good or you're going to get surpassed by the person who is good at the new thing. That's how it's always been. So I have come to ask myself, \"Do you want to be the last of a dying breed or do you want to be at the very forefront of the cutting edge?\" \n\nJust some food for thought. What do you think?</p>\n          <p><em>Posted on: 2023-11-21 16:33:31</em></p>\n          \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7132768000637599744/\" target=\"_blank\">View on LinkedIn</a></p>\n        </div>\n      \n        <div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n          <p>I’m thrilled and humbled to announce I have recently upgraded my Town Hall to level 12.
